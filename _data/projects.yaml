  description: Stress is known to cause a variety of structural and functional changes across brain structures. We aim to delineate the role of a number of important circuits in supporting motivated and goal-directed behaviors and assess changes in these circuits as a result of stress exposure. We will use an array of in vivo techniques and longitudinal studies to accomplish this aim.
