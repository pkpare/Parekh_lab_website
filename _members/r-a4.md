Yara El Zoghby joined the Parekh Lab after completing her B.S. in Biology and M.S. in Biological Sciences at the Lebanese American University (LAU). She is interested in the molecular and circuit-level mechanisms underlying effort-based behavior, with a focus on how stress differentially engages neural systems to promote susceptibility or resilience. In the Parekh Lab, Yara studies how stress alters neural circuits that regulate motivation, integrating molecular and systems-level approaches. Her long-term goal is to pursue a career in academia as a mentor. Outside the lab, Yara loves cats, enjoys singing, and spends her time playing music.
