Before joining the Parekh Lab at UT Dallas, Austin earned his bachelor’s degree in Biological Psychology from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and his master’s degree in Academic Research Neuroscience from Cal Poly Humboldt. He is interested in studying the cellular systems and circuits governing motivated behavior, effort, rapid decision-making, and choice. To accomplish this, he uses naturalistic free-moving behavioral assays, fiber photometry, and deep-learning analysis tools. Austin plans to pursue a Ph.D. with the goal of eventually leading his own lab. Outside the lab, he enjoys playing volleyball, cooking, and reading Stephen King novels.
