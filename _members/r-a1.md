Alexa joined the Parekh Lab in 2024 as a research assistant after completing both her B.S. in Neuroscience and M.S. in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience at UT Dallas. She is interested in the neurobiological basis of psychiatric disorders. In the Parekh Lab, Alexa works with head-fixed operant tasks and fiber photometry to explore how stress influences neural circuitry involved in effort-based motivation and resilience. She plans to pursue a physician-scientist career that integrates patient care with neuroscience research. In her free time, she enjoys running, Pilates, exploring cafes around Dallas, and spending time with her two cats and dog.
