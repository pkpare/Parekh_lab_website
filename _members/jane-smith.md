Dr. Parekh received her Bachelor's degree in Neuroscience from the College of William and Mary where she engaged in undergraduate research in Psychology and Applied Science. She went on to join Duke University as a Research Technician working under Dr. Wolfgang Liedtke prior to enrolling in the graduate training program of the Center for Neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh. For her doctoral thesis work with Dr. Colleen McClung, Dr. Parekh studied the regulation of mood and reward-related behaviors and synaptic plasticity within limbic structures as a result of core circadian gene disruptions. She subsequently joined the lab of Dr. Conor Liston at Weill Cornell Medicine as a postdoctoral fellow to continue exploring animal models with relevance to psychiatric conditions. She currently holds the position of Assistant Professor of Neuroscience within the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences at the University of Texas Dallas.
