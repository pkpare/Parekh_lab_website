# Current Opportunities

<!--### Staff Positions
We are looking to fill 1-2 open positions for the role of Research Technician. This is a great opportunity for hands-on, full-time research experience. Applicants should hold at minimum a Bachelor's degree in a relevant field such as Neuroscience, Psychology, Biology, Computational biology, etc. Please send an inquiry with CV or resume attached to Dr. Parekh at pkp2002@med.cornell.edu.-->

### Postdoctoral scholars
Funding for a postdoctoral associate is currently available to support one of our ongoing projects. 

### Graduate students
We accept graduate students who have already been admitted to one of the following programs: 

[Cognition and Neuroscience PhD Program](https://bbs.utdallas.edu/departments/neuroscience/graduate-programs/cognition-and-neuroscience-phd/) <br>


### Undergraduate students
If you are interested in working in the lab, please fill out the [Undergraduate Research Interest Form](https://forms.office.com/r/QD7qYbh2Et).  We encourage you to fill out this form (rather than to email us directly) to demonstrate that you have read through our website and understand the expectations for undergraduate researchers in our lab.  When positions become available, lab personnel will look through the form responses to identify candidates whose interests and goals align best with their research projects.  At that time, they will reach out to candidates directly to request additional materials (e.g. resume) and schedule interviews.  This communication typically occurs 1-2 months prior to the start of the semester, with hiring occuring at the beginning of the semester.
